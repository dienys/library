== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

As we are not using SQLLITE but MySQL, you will need to follow those steps:

* Configuration
exec bundle install

* Database creation
exec gem install mysql2
exec mysql-ctl install
exec phpmyadmin-ctl install
exec mysql-ctl start

* Database initialization
exec rake db:migrate
exec rake db:seed

* Launch rails server
exec rails server -p 8081 -b $IP
